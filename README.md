# Deep-Learning Based Tracking for Mobile Sensing

_Group Collaborators: Krisha Adhikari (kadhikari@umass.edu), Aadarsha Rai (aadarsharai@umass.edu_

**Motivation**

**Design goals**
-Developing deep learning tracking algorithm for two mobile systems
-Will include implementing TartanVO, a visual odometry model and benchmarking it with multiple datasets

**Deliverables** 
**System blocks** 
**hw/sw requirements**
-Need to know how to code in Python
-Need a laptop/PC with a CUDA enabled GPU

**Team members responsibilities** 
**Project timeline**
